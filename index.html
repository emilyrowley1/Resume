                Hey! My name is Emily Rowley and I grew up on a fruit farm in Santaquin, Utah.
                In addition to spending time with my family, training horses, and reading, I am passionate
                about learning, growth, and improvement. I love learning and trying new things even if I'm not
                great at it my first try. :)

                    <p>
                        At eight years old I started working on our family fruit farm with my siblings and cousins.
                        I learned at a very young age that with cooperation and hard work you can literly move
                        mountains!
                        I started out doing small jobs but as the years have gone on the complexity and importance of
                        the
                        work has increased. Some of my favorite jobs over the years have been leveling roads and feilds
                        with
                        the road grader, driving the cherry harvester, turning on wind machines to protect against
                        frost, and
                        checking the orchards for pests.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently I am working on as a social media marketing consultant to help sell our fruit to new
                        markets. Below are some of the videos I have made to advertize on social media.

                    <h4>Payson Fruit Growers | 2018 - 2019 | Warehouse Supervisor</h4>
                    After finishing my first semster at Snow College I had about 2 months before I left for
                    a voluenteer misson for my church. Durning this time I assembled and oversaw shipments
                    out of the Payson Fruit Grower's warehouse. Although my time there was limited I learned
                    the importance of keeping good records and staying organized.
                    </p>

            <h4 class="h3">Snow College | 2018-2021 | Software Engineering</h4>
            After returning from my voluenteer mission to New York City I returned to Snow College. At first I
            was pretty lost as to what degree I should purse. After taking a programing class I knew that Software
            Engineering was for me. I love that in this degree I will continue to learn throughout my life. Coding is
            something I genuinly enjoy doing and I'm excited for the things I will learn and accomplish.
